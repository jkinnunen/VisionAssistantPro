## Changes for 4.0.3
*   **Enhanced Network Resilience:** Added an automatic retry mechanism to better handle unstable internet connections and temporary server errors, ensuring more reliable AI responses.
*   **Visual Translation Dialog:** Introduced a dedicated window for translation results. Users can now easily navigate and read long translations line-by-line, similar to OCR results.
*   **Aggregated Formatted View:** The "View Formatted" feature in the Document Reader now displays all processed pages in a single, organized window with clear page headers.
*   **Optimized OCR Workflow:** Automatically skips the page range selection for single-page documents, making the recognition process faster and more seamless.
*   **Improved API Stability:** Switched to a more robust header-based authentication method, resolving potential "All API Keys failed" errors caused by key rotation conflicts.
*   **Bug Fixes:** Resolved several potential crashes, including an issue during add-on termination and a focus error in the chat dialog.
